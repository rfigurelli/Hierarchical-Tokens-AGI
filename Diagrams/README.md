# Diagrams

This folder contains architectural and conceptual diagrams supporting the white paper.

The diagrams aim to visually illustrate the key ideas and structural mechanisms proposed, helping readers better understand how hierarchical tokenization can enhance natural language generation and cognitive planning in AI systems.

## Contents

- **Architecture**: High-level system design for hierarchical token prediction across different abstraction layers (words, sentences, paragraphs, sections, domains).
- **Flow Diagrams**: Representations of data flow, attention mechanisms, and cross-level feedback loops.
- **Simulation Examples**: Visualizations of hierarchical sampling processes based on structured contexts.

These visual aids are intended to complement the written explanations in the white paper, offering a clearer and more intuitive grasp of the proposed framework.
