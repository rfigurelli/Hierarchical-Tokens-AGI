# Hierarchical Tokens for Structured General Intelligence

Repository: Hierarchical-Tokens-AGI

This repository introduces the conceptual framework **Hierarchical Tokens for Structured General Intelligence**, originally disclosed in the white paper:

**Hierarchical Tokens: Structuring Transformers for AGI**, published on April 25, 2025.

Instead of relying solely on token-level prediction (word by word), this approach introduces **hierarchical tokenization**, treating higher-level language units—such as sentences, paragraphs, sections, and even chapters—as "macro-tokens" within a structured predictive system.

The core idea is simple: apply the same mechanism used to predict the next word, but at multiple levels of abstraction. By organizing language generation hierarchically, this method enables more coherent reasoning, intentionality, and narrative consistency—paving the way toward **Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)**.
